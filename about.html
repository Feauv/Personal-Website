            <p class="description">I am a Developer with past experience in Mobile Development (specifically iOS) and have most recently have gotten a start in Front-End Development. 
            I attended the University of Iowa and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering, from my time at Iowa I learned a lot C++ and Java and towards the end
            of my college career I got some experience in Full-Stack Web Development and Software Engineering concepts and practices. Since graduation, I have leaned more about Front-End 
            Development and also making a shift towards UI/UX Design. I am somewhat of a novice in these fields but I feel like they are a good fit for what I want to do with my life which is 
            Web Development/Design. When it comes to Front-End Development I am eager to learn, and as of right now I know a good amount of JavaScript, but I am continuing learn more, while also
            beginning to learn React, Typescript, and the Fundamentals of Design such as Color Theory, Design Patterns, etc.</p>
