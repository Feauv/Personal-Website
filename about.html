            <p class="description">I am a Developer with experience in Mobile Development (specifically iOS) and have most recently have gotten a start in Front-End Development. 
            I attended the University of Iowa and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering, from my time at Iowa I learned a lot C++ and Java and towards the end
            of my college career, I got some experience in Full-Stack Web Development and Software Engineering concepts and practices. Since graduation, I have learned more about Front-End 
            Development and also making a shift towards UI/UX Design. I am somewhat of a novice in these fields but I feel like they are a good fit for what I want to do with my life which is 
            Web Development/Design. When it comes to Front-End Development I am eager to learn, and as of right now I know a good amount of JavaScript, but I am continuing to learn more, while 
            also beginning to learn React, Typescript, and the Fundamentals of Design</p>

            <div class="title">About The Site</div>
            <p class="description">I wanted this site to act as a portfolio for my best projects, provide my contact info, all of that great stuff while also showcasing my Web Development and Design 
            skills as I continue to improve. This site is still in its early stages so there is much more design ideas to come but for now, its just a place for anyone to get to know what 
            I've done and what I am working on. Even this "About The Site" section will have more in the future with a look at the color scheme, my process, and where I got inspiration 
            from.
