            <p class="description">My first ever Hackathon was TigerHacks in Missouri University and I came into not expecting much, just to learn. Coming into the event I really just had 
                experience in iOS Development outside of the classroom and I wanted to expand my knowledge on it. I ended grouping up with these two IT majors 
                <a href="https://github.com/okrek6">Brendan Krekeler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nathanb95">Nathan Banderas</a> went to Missouri and they knew a lot about 
                iOS Development.TigerHacks theme was Media, so we set out to create a mobile application that could be used to record, transcribe the recording in real-time, and implement 
                functionality for the user to flag and take notes on certain parts of the trancription/record. We thought this we be a great utility for interviews, meetings, anything that you 
                wanted recorded that you wanted to analyze and take notes on.
            </p>
            <div class="subtitle">User Interface</div>
            <p class="description">My primary role within the group was to design and program the user interface. I wanted the application to flow while also being aesthetically pleasing. I 
                created a simple to understand home screen that gave the user a New option to create a new Note(what we called the record/transcriptions), an Open option to view all their saved 
                Notes, and a view of all their recent Notes. When the user chose the New option they were directed to a dashboard type setup where they can record, flag, and type notes at flags. 
                The Open option took the user to their folders of Notes if you directed into a folder and chose a Note a Player type screen would pop up and this is where is the user could 
                playback their Notes. When I look back at this user interface there is a ton I would change to it, but the more I think about it, it was a Hackathon and I was an inexperienced 
                programmer so it makes sense why it may not be the best.
            </p>
            <div class="subtitle">Implementations</div>
            <p class="description">Like most Hackathon projects, there was a ton of implementations that we did not end up finishing. The main ones were Core Data, Flags, and the Player. For 
                demoing our application it was not hard because we had mock data to show how it would look if you had Notes, and our main functionality that we wanted finished was the text to 
                speech, so we were able to show that off.
            </p>
            <div class="subtitle">Takeaways</div>
            <p class="description">I think building SplitNote really put into perspective how much goes into app development and it was great experience to meet so many developers and see what 
                people made. Seeing all of those projects and working on our projects improved me as a developer and designer, its just a shame that Hackathons are so short.
            </p>
            <div class="notes">Additional Notes: If you are demoing the application inside Xcode, iPhone 11 is the best to run it on. We did not have much time to make it responsive at 
                the Hackathon.

            <div class="keywords">JavaScript, D3</div>
            <p class="description">For my Principles of Senior Design course at the University of Iowa we had various labs that prepared us for Senior Design course in the Spring where we 
                would work on our Engineering capstone project. The lab I enjoyed the most and felt I learned a lot from was Lab 1 where we had to use a microcontroller with a temperature sensor 
                to send temperature data to a Web App that would live temperature on a graph while also give functionality to set text updates. Both of my teammates 
                <a href="https://github.com/RichDeFano">Rich DeFano</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Dylan-Gardner">Dylan Gardner</a> knew a lot about hardware and setting up the server, so 
                my focus was the Web App which meant learning JavaScript and becoming familiar with D3 a JavaScript Data Visualization Library. The main challenges of this Front-End were 
                creating an interface that was great at relaying data to user, and learning JavaScript and D3 from scratch. I made sure that I constructed an interface that was in one window 
                and not cluttered but after that learning D3 was the hardest part. The most challenging part of my experience with D3 was programming our graph to continually update which 
                honestly took as much time as it took me to program the interface. Once we were finished it was a very satisfying project to witness, definitely one of best Embedded Systems 
                projects I have ever worked on. This lab was a great experience for what I want to do as a developer and I learned a lot from my teammates. Introducing myself to JavaScript and D3 was 
                interesting and a library like D3 is a insanely versatile tool for Data Visualization.

            <p class="description">In the Summer after my Sophomore year I was hired as an intern for True Industries, a company out of Bowling Green, Kentucky that had previously worked on 
                mostly game development and design. At True I worked GVE which was an application they were outsourced to create that strived to connect people to their favorite charities 
                financially. The one big idea of GVE was they wanted to implement a round-up functionality, like what you see for an application like 
                <a href="https://www.acorns.com/?s1=adwords&s2=desktopbrand&s3=acornsexact&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3ZX4BRDmARIsAFYh7ZLsLgfJ1HrFfwHHSPRupq1JHvQZlsnWdhGgMny_-aC-TH3mlBzFWuEaAvpHEALw_wcB">Acorns</a> 
                where instead of rounding up the cents on your purchases for investing, they rounded up for charities. So my job was to program an interface based off of the mock-ups I was given 
                on <a href="https://sympli.io/">Sympli</a> which is essentially a design collaboration plugin, while also working with the Plaid API, a widely used financial API that enables 
                user to log into their bank accounts. Ultimately True Industries ended up dropping the project for business reasons, but I learned a ton of Swift in my time with True and I so 
                glad I got to work with such a well-known API like Plaid. It was a shame that GVE fell through but the knowledge I got from the experience was amazing.
